# stderred

stderr in red.

This fork adds improved support for [DomTerm](https://domterm.org):
If the `DOMTERM` environment variable is set, emits the DomTerm-specfic
escape sequendes for entering/exiting stderr.  This works better if there
are other escape sequences in stderr; it also allows more flexible styling.

## About

stderred hooks on write() and a family of stream functions (fwrite, fprintf,
error...) from libc in order to colorize all stderr output that goes to
terminal thus making it distinguishable from stdout.  Basically it wraps text
that goes to file with descriptor "2" with proper ANSI escape codes making text
red.

It's implemented as a shared library and doesn't require recompilation of
existing binaries thanks to _preload/insert_ feature of dynamic linkers.

It's supported on Linux (with `LD_PRELOAD`), FreeBSD (also `LD_PRELOAD`) and
OSX (with `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`).

Watch this [intro asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/1705) to see it in action.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/ku1ik/stderred.git
    $ cd stderred

Important: In all cases below make sure that path to `libstderred.so` is absolute!

### Linux and FreeBSD

Make sure you have cmake and the gcc toolchain required for compilation installed:

    # Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake

    # Fedora
    sudo yum install make cmake gcc gcc-c++

    # FreeBSD
    pkg install cmake

Build:

    $ make

Export `LD_PRELOAD` variable in your shell's config file by putting following
in your .bashrc/.zshrc:

    export LD_PRELOAD="/absolute/path/to/stderred/build/libstderred.so${LD_PRELOAD:+:$LD_PRELOAD}"

#### Multi-arch Linux and FreeBSD

On some Linux distros you can install 32-bit packages on 64-bit system.  Shared
libraries compiled for 64-bit doesn't work with 32-bit binaries though. It
happens that 64-bit binaries call 32-bit ones resulting in warning message
printed to terminal about not compatible `LD_PRELOAD` shared lib.

Fortunately Linux's dynamic linker has a feature called Dynamic String Token
(DST). It allows dynamic substitution of `$LIB` token in `LD_PRELOAD` variable
with "lib" or "lib64" respectively for 32 and 64-bit binaries when the binary
is being run. Thanks to that you can compile stderred for both architectures
and automatically use proper version of this shared library.

On 64-bit Fedora, for example, you need to install libc development headers for
both architectures:

    $ sudo yum install glibc-devel.i686 glibc-devel.x86_64

compile it like this:

    $ make 32 && make 64

and export `LD_PRELOAD` like this in your shell's config:

    export LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/stderred/\$LIB/libstderred.so${LD_PRELOAD:+:$LD_PRELOAD}"

_\* Note that [there is no support for $LIB token on Ubuntu](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.glibc.user/974)._

### OSX

    $ make

Export `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` variable in your shell's config file by putting following
in your .bashrc/.zshrc:

    export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES="/absolute/path/to/build/libstderred.dylib${DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES:+:$DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES}"

#### Universal lib on OSX

OSX solves multi-arch problem (described above in "Multi-arch Linux and
FreeBSD") by supporting so called "universal" libraries that include 2 copies
of code compiled for both 32 and 64-bit architecture in the single library
file.

If you feel you will want universal library then build it this way:

    $ make universal

and export shell env like above.

### Checking if it works

    $ find -q
    $ cat nonexistingfile
    $ ls nonexistingfile
    $ python -c 'import os; print "Yo!"; os.write(2, "Jola\n\r")'
    $ STDERRED_ESC_CODE=$(echo -e '\e[;92m') ruby -e 'puts "Yo!"; warn "Jola"'

"Jola" should be printed in red color.

## Alternative way: aliasing

Alternative to enabling it globally via shell config is to create alias and
use it to selectively colorize stderr for the commands you run:

    $ alias stderred="LD_PRELOAD=/absolute/path/to/build/libstderred.so\${LD_PRELOAD:+:\$LD_PRELOAD}"
    $ stderred java lol

## Configuration

### Custom color code

If you prefer other color or you want to use additional escape codes
(for bold/bright, italic, different background) you can export
`STDERRED_ESC_CODE` with desired escape code sequence.

Here's an example for bold red:

    bold=$(tput bold || tput md)
    red=$(tput setaf 1)
    export STDERRED_ESC_CODE=`echo -e "$bold$red"`

### Program Blacklisting

Some programs abuse stderr and print stuff on it even when they really
shouldn't.  If you want to turn off stderred for particular programs you can
export `STDERRED_BLACKLIST` with a desired POSIX Extended Regular Expression
matching names of these programs.

Here's an example that will blacklist bash, and all programs with names
starting with "test":

    export STDERRED_BLACKLIST="^(bash|test.*)$"
